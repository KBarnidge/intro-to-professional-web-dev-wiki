## In the prep work this week (HTML, Git, Terminal), the students learned:

1. Basic HTML tags:
   1. ``<b>, <em>, <a>, <img>, <br>, <p>, <span>, <div>, <form>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>``
   1. How to add attributes.
1. How to structure static HTML pages:
   1. doctype, ``<html>, <head>, <body>, <title>``
   1. Whitespace
1. What Git is and why we want to use a version control system (VCS).
1. How to initialize and commit to a local git repository.
1. Terminal basics.

## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Announcements

1. Check with your class Candidate Engagement Manager for any other announcements.

### Class 12 Topics That Require More Attention

1. Live coding:
   1. Build a simple, static web page from scratch.
   1. Accept suggestions from the students for elements, text color, etc.
   1. Note tedious aspects as they appear (e.g. making EVERY h2 red), and note that we will learn how to streamline this process in the next class.
1. Reinforce why using a VCS is a good idea. If you have a personal story that relates to this, feel free to share it!
   1. If time, initialize a simple git repo for the web page you created. Show how edits (or mistakes) can be undone with git.
1. Don't be afraid to use the terminal.
1. Studio intro. Task uses browser developer tools.

## Studio (TA Notes)

1. Common student stumbling blocks:
   1. Finding the dev tools for their particular browser version.
   1. Using copyrighted images. This studio probably falls under fair use so long as the work does not get posted elsewhere. However, it would be a good idea to remind your students that just because something is found on the web, that does NOT mean it's free to use. If in doubt, DON'T.
1. Encourage having fun! Ooooh and aaaaah as you check in with each of your students.
