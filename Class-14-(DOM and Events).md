## In the prep work this week (DOM and Events), the students learned:

1. JavaScript in the browser and in Node.js are two different environments
1. DOM objects and methods are used to alter an HTML web page
1. That JavaScript is an event driven language
1. To handle events in JavaScript using the `addEventListener` function.
1. What it means to trigger an event.


## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Announcements

1. TODO: Anything specific?
1. Check with your class Candidate Engagement Manager for any other announcements.

### Topics That Require More Attention

1. Point out that JavaScript is included in a web page by using `<script>` tags.
1. Functions being passed as arguments to `addEventListener` will likely confuse some students.
1. If event handling isn't work, remind the students to double check the HTML and the JS to be sure the correct elements are being referenced. As always typos will make your code fail.
1. Making sure the students understand that the DOM represents the page and can be used to edit the page and to respond to user actions.
1. Encourage use of the developers in the browser.

## Studio (TA Notes)

1. To start the studio the students will need to fork and then clone a repository. Some may struggle with this.
1. Go over the starter HTML with the students.
