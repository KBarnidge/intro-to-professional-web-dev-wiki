NOTE: This repo does NOT have a .md extension, so that it does NOT show up on the wiki.

This repo exists to create feature branches and PRs for
the Intro to Professional Web Dev Wiki https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev/wiki.
Commits on this repo need to be pushed to the repo behind https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev/wiki.

# History
The repo behind https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev/wiki is not a normal repo.
That repo can NOT be seen via the github UI, therefor it does NOT allow for the creation of PRs.

We wanted PRs for two reasons
1. QA process for Education team
2. Allow contributions from outside Education team by forking and submitting a PR

# Created intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki Repo (this repo)
Any additions or updates that need to appear on https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev/wiki
should be committed to this repo. That requires two repos to synced. That syncing is done by manually pushing commits
to two repositories.

# Deploying to Publicly Visible Wiki
To deploy new commits to the visible wiki https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev/wiki,
run the ./deploy-to-wiki.sh in the root of this repo. We attempted to do this step with Travis CI,
but it did not work as expected.
