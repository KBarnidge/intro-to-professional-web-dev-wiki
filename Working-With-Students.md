# Communication
Positive and productive communication between instructors, TAs and students is vital to a successful class.

# Be Positive
Students will be looking to instructors, TAs, and the curriculum for knowledge and guidance. Have empathy when
speaking to students. Learning to code is not an easy task. Keep in mind that we all learn at different speeds and in different ways. Be supportive and patient as the students demonstrate and describe their issues.

## Support the Curriculum
* Do not speak negatively of the curriculum in front of the students.
* Do not suggest that the students should be learning something else.

# In-class Facilitation
* Lecture
  * The lecture will be led by the instructor.
  * The lecture should last 45 minutes to 1 hour.
  * Lecture content
    * Review topics in the lesson prep-work
    * Ask students if any topics were confusing
    * Provide relevant, but new examples.

* Studios
* Checking in with individual students

# Common Student Issues
* Falling behind
* Keeping advanced students engaged
* Skipping course activities (e.g. prep work or studios)
* Poor attendance
