## Studio (TA Notes)

1. Common student stumbling blocks:
   1. Some students get confused trying to follow the instructions, especially as they alternate between the **Control** and **Pilot** roles. Be ready to provide clarification.
   1. Intimidation when merge conflicts happen. Note that these happen all the time, and they are not that big of a deal.
1. This studio requires students to work in pairs. If you have an odd number of students, you will need to fill in that gap yourself.
