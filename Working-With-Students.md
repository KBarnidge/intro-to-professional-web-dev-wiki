# Communication
Positive and productive communication between instructors, TAs, and students is vital to a successful class.

## Be Empathetic and Positive
Students will be looking to instructors, TAs, and the curriculum for knowledge and guidance. Have empathy when speaking to students, remember that learning to code is not an easy task. Keep in mind that we all learn at different speeds and in different ways. Be supportive and patient as the students demonstrate and describe their issues.
