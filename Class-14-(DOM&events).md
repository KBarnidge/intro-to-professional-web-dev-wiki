1. 

## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Announcements

1. Check with your class Candidate Engagement Manager for any other announcements.

### Class 14 Topics That Require More Attention

1. 

## Studio (TA Notes)

1. This is a GREAT studio for automatic, positive feedback ("LOOK! The rocket moves where I tell it to!"). Absolutely encourage your students to play beyond the given tasks.
1. Common student stumbling blocks:
    1. Depending on your students' questions, consider a 5 minute reminder on how to:
        1. Find and fork the starter code GitHub repository.
        1. Clone the remote repository to a local folder.
    1. Syntax errors can be tricky to find in this studio. Be patient. Encourage your students to proceed one small step at a time (code works, make small change, ensure code still works, make change, etc.).
1. Encourage quick-finishers to try the bonus mission.
