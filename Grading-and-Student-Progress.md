# Student Data
Attendance records, grades, and other progress indicators can be found in Canvas and repl.it classroom. Each data point has a specific use. Remember that Canvas is the source of truth in regards to the student's status in the class.

## Data Stored in Canvas
* Attendance record
  * Manually entered by TAs  
  * **Counts in** final grade for student
* Graded Assignment Grade
  * Manually entered by TAs
  * **Counts in** final grade for student
* Concept Checks Grade
  * Auto graded
  * Does **NOT count** in final grade for student

## Student Work
Early in the class student work is stored in *repl.it classroom*, later on *github repositories* are used.
* Exercise Solutions
  * These are at home practice that **is NOT graded**
* Studio Solutions
  * In class practice that **is NOT graded**
* Graded Assignment Solutions
  * At home work that **is graded**


# Grading
## Attendance
Attendance is recorded in Canvas. Find the attendance assignment in Canvas for the class you are taking attendance for.

1. Review the student's work

   * Work will be in repl.it classroom or github
   * A live demo may also be required depending on assignment instructions
   * When in repl.it classroom, you will need to click *Mark complete* if the code meets all requirements

2. Enter grade in Canvas
   * If the code meets the requirements, then mark the assignment complete in Canvas
   * More about feedback in the [feedback section](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev/wiki/Grading-and-Student-Progress#feedback)

# Student Progress
The student's work and data in Canvas can be used to gauge how well the student is doing. Also use in person check-ins to get a full picture of how a student is doing.
* Attendance Record
  * If a student doesn't come to class, then they are likely going to struggle.
* Concept Checks
  * Quizzes in canvas that are assigned as prep work
  * If students are failing to get these correct, that means they are **not** understanding the reading material.
* Exercises
  * Practice problems in repl.it classroom that are assigned as prep work
  * Check repl.it classroom to see if students are attempting these and if they are having success
  * NOTE: There is a way to give feedback in repl.it classroom
* Graded Assignments
  * This is when students but multiple concepts together to solve a larger problem
  * Students often struggle getting started and putting all the concepts together
  * Student work can be seen in repl.it classroom

# Feedback
Feedback on student work is a great time to highlight things the student did well and also inform students of bad programming practices. Be positive, empathetic, and reassuring when talking to the student about their code. There are multiple ways to give feedback.

## Feedback in Person
Reviewing student code in class is a great way to give instant feedback. **DO NOT** code a solution for the student. Be clear about what they did right. Ask questions about their code. Inform student of best practices and give hints about solutions.

## Feedback in Canvas
Feedback can be given for graded assignments on the grading form. See [section on Canvas grading](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev/wiki/Grading-and-Student-Progress#canvas-grade-form) for how to open grading form. 

## Feedback in repl.it Classroom
There is feedback section when looking at a student's submission in repl.it classroom. Type in your comments there when reviewing exercises and studios or grading the graded assignments.
NOTE: You **do NOT** have to click *send back* for the student to see the feedback. Only use *send back* when there is a clear need for the student to update their code.
