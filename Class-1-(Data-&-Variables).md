## In the prep work this week, the students learned:
1. How to declare, initialize, and reassign variables,
1. The ``number`` and ``string`` data types, and how to convert between them,
1. The mathematical operators (``+, -, *, /, **, %, ++, --``) and order of operations,
1. The ``typeof`` keyword and how to collect user input with ``readline-sync``.

## Announcements
1. Welcome! First day pep talk.
1. Class 2 prep work should be active by the end of class.

## Large Group Time (Instructor)
### First Class Reminders
1. Use Canvas to access course content.
1. Have a Repl.it account:
   1. Review workspace panels and important menu items (this can be done in the live coding examples).
   1. Use the link posted in Canvas to enroll in the repl.it _classroom_.
1. Expectations for students:
   1. Do ALL of the prep work before class.
   1. Ask questions often.
   1. Make use of the help and resources available.
1. Introduce the TAs and assign groups (may be done during the studio intro).
1. Other relevant contact information.

### Class 1 Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. ``let`` vs. ``const``. When should each be used?
1. Discourage the use of ``var``.
1. ``+=``, ``-=``, etc. can be used as a shortcut (e.g. ``num = num + 3`` vs. ``num += 3``).
1. Modulus!!!
   1. This is likely a new idea for many of the students. Provide a clear, deliberate explanation (with examples) of what it does.
   1. Why would we need to use ``%``? Don't get too detailed yet, but note some simple scenarios where it might be necessary. The students do not know ``if/else`` yet, so keep your explanation non-code specific.
1. Walk through the syntax and how to use ``readline-sync`` to collect user input from the console.
   1. Define **console** and point it out in repl.it.
   1. Live coding examples.
1. Overview of how studio sessions run and how to best take advantage of the time.
   1. Tasks will be completed in repl.it classroom.
   1. Studios provide focused practice in a supervised, safe space. Students are free to explore, make mistakes, and ask for tips.
   1. Studios are NOT graded, but participation is essential for success.
   1. Encourage students to have their TAs check their code.
   1. Provide a quick lead in to the Data & Variables studio.
   1. Note that the large group will meet again tonight to do a post-op of the studio task.

## Studio (TA Notes)

### Best Practices for ALL Studios
1. Check in with EVERY student in EVERY studio.
   1. This builds relationships and trust, and it helps you spot potential issues before they get too large.
   1. Checking in does NOT mean a quick question like, "How are you doing? Need any help?" Instead, sit next to the student and ask specific questions about their code, their interpretation of the instructions, or their coding dreams.
   1. Provide detailed feedback as often as possible. "Good job!" does not cut it.
1. Be prepared to clarify the studio instructions beyond just re-reading the words on the screen.
1. Encourage students to work together and share ideas.
1. Assist individuals as questions arise. Address frequent mistakes and/or questions to your whole group.
1. Make a note of any issues that occur during the studio and provide that feedback to the instructor and LaunchCode team.

### Class 1 Studio
1. Help students successfully navigate to Repl.it Classroom and find the Data and Variables studio.
1. Encourage best-practices for variable names.
1. Studios are NOT graded, but for this first task you should do a visual check of each student's output.
   1. The best time to do this is during the studio!
   1. If a student does not finish by the end of class, they should complete the studio at home and click "Submit". You will be able to check their code from within Repl.it.
1. Common mistake:
   1. Some students will miss the idea of using variables to create the output. Instead, they will hard code the data values into the ``console.log`` statements.
   1. Encourage the students to use variables, and explain that doing so allows the output to reflect any changes in the data.
   1. When the students run their code for you, ask them to change ``astronautCount`` to a different number (like 3), and then verify that the output reflects the new value.
1. Recognize any clever ideas that the students use to print the tedious parts of the output.
1. Even though you do a visual check of the code, students should still click "Submit" when they finish the studio. That way, they preserve a record of their participation.
