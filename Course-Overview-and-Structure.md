# Methodology

## Blended Learning
The course is delivered using a combination of online tasks, in person instruction, small peer group time, and programming assignments. The varied delivery is meant to reinforcing the concepts in different ways.

### Flipped Classroom Model
Most of the traditional instruction will be done at home via online reading and exercises. In class time will be spent reviewing concepts, examples, and working on small programming tasks called studios.

## Course Goals
Teach students, from wide ranging backgrounds, these topics:
* Learn how to learn (learning mindset)
* Problem solving skills
* Basic programming using JavaScript
* Introduction of web development concepts

This content is meant to be a start and not the finish. With these skills students can proceed into more complex areas.

# Class Structure
* Prep work
  * Certain chapters 
* Primary Instruction
  * Every class has a primary instruction session led by the instructor
  * Lasts 45 minutes to 1 hour
  * Content (As needed, will contain one or multiple of these)
    * Review topics in the lesson prep-work (reading and exercises)
    * Student Q&A
    * Provide additional relevant examples
    * Programming assignment walk through/introduction (new assignment every 3-4 weeks)
    * Studio introduction
* Studio
  * The students break off into smaller groups led by a TA
  * Lasts 1 to 1.5 hours
  * TODO: how to describe what the groups do with the studio?
* Programming Assignments
  * Students are required to complete and submit six programming assignments
  * If students do not turn in assignments by a certain date, they can not continue in the class

# Tasks and Responsibilities
Instructors and TAs are a crucial to the success of the students. These tasks help insure that everyone knows
their role in the process.

## Instructors
* Report Issues to LaunchCode (LC) staff
  * Contact LC staff by slack, email, or phone.
  * LC staff needs to know about issues with: students, TAs, facilities, curriculum, course tools
* Facilitate all-class activities
  * The instructor controls the flow of the class.
  * Examples
    * What to review/demo in primary instruction
    * If to bring class back together after studio time
    * If to hold a TA standup after class
* Monitor and respond to student struggles
  * Do not assume a topic is easy to learn, pay attention to the class and adjust examples and duration as needed.
  * Look for signs of *large* numbers of students struggling and falling behind.
  * Use feedback from the students and TAs to determine how to cover the topic more effectively.
* Manage and coach TAs
  * TODO: what level of managing and coaching?

## Teaching Assistants (TAs)
TAs will be assigned a group of students to work with.
* Assist individual students
  * Check in on each student in your group once every class
  * Answer individual student questions
  * Help an individual student through a code problem
* Monitor and respond to individual student struggles
  * TODO: not sure on this
* Facilitate studios and other small-group activities
  * TAs will lead group time activities
  * Deliver the activities listed in Canvas
* Grading
  * TAs are responsible for verifying student work and entering a grade into Canvas
  * Grade fairly and consistently
  * Report possible cheating to LC staff
