## In the prep work this week, the students learned:
1. How to declare, initialize, and reassign variables,
1. The ``number`` and ``string`` data types, and how to convert between them,
1. The mathematical operators (``+, -, *, /, **, %, ++, --``) and order of operations,
1. The ``typeof`` keyword and how to collect user input with ``readline-sync``.

## Announcements
1. Welcome! First day pep talk.
1. Class 2 prep work should be active by the end of class.

## Large Group Time
### First Class Reminders
1. Use Canvas to access course content
1. Have a Repl.it account
   1. Review workspace panels and important menu items (this can be done in the live coding examples).
   1. Use the link posted in Canvas to enroll in the repl.it _classroom_.
1. Expectations for students:
   1. Do ALL of the prep work before class.
   1. Ask questions often.
   1. Make use of the help and resources available.
1. Introduce the TAs and assign groups (may be done during the studio intro).
1. Other relevant contact information.

### Class 1 Topics That Require More Attention 
1. ``let`` vs. ``const``. When should each be used?
1. Discourage the use of ``var``. Students will see examples of ``var`` in many code samples. Be sure to explain why it is no longer preferred.
1. ``+=``, ``-=``, etc. can be used as a shortcut (``num = num + 3`` vs. ``num += 3``).
1. Modulus!!!
   1. This is likely a new idea for many of the students. Provide a clear, deliberate explanation (with examples) of what it does.
   1. Why would we need to use ``%``? Don't get too detailed yet, but note some simple scenarios where it might be necessary. The students do not know ``if/else`` yet, so keep your explanation non-code specific.
1. Walk through the syntax and how to use ``readline-sync`` to collect user input from the console.
   1. Define **console** and point it out in repl.it.
   1. Live coding examples.
1. Overview of how studio sessions run and how to best take advantage of the time.
   1. Tasks will be completed in repl.it classroom.
   1. Studio assignments must be submitted by the due date so the TAs can review the work and provide feedback before the next class.
   1. Display the studio instructions page and provide a quick lead in.
   1. Note that the large group will meet again tonight to do a post-op of the studio task.

## Studio (TA Notes)
1. Help students successfully navigate to Repl.it Classroom and find the Data and Variables studio.
1. Assist individuals as questions arise. Encourage best-practices for variable names. Also encourage students to work together and share ideas.
1. If necessary, address frequent mistakes and/or questions for your group.
1. Make a note of any issues that arise during the studio time and provide that feedback to the instructor and LaunchCode team.

### Checking Outputs
1. This studio will NOT be auto-graded, so you will have to do a visual check of each student's output.
   1. The best time to do this is during the studio!
   1. Some students will miss the idea of using variables to create the output. Instead, they will hard code the data values into the ``console.log`` statements. Encourage the students to use variables, and explain that doing so allows the output to reflect any changes in the data.
      1. When the students run their code for you, ask them to change ``astronautCount`` to a different number (like 3), and then verify that the output reflects the new value.
   1. Recognize any clever ideas that the students use to print the tedious parts of the output.
1. Even though you do a visual check of the code, students must still click "Submit" when they finish the studio.
1. To record student work as complete for manually graded studios:
   1. Open the Student Overview panel in Repl.it Classroom.
   1. For each of your students, click on the "Awaiting Feedback" symbol to pull up the code.
      1. If you verified the code in class, you can just click "Mark As Complete".
      1. If a student submitted their work outside of class, you must run the code yourself to verify it. If acceptable, "Mark As Complete". If corrections need to be made, provide feedback and click "Send Back".
      1. If you send back the code, it will NOT be marked as complete. Be sure to contact the student to let them know that you made comments on their work, and that they need to re-submit it. Touch base with the student in the next studio session to answer any remaining questions.
