## In the prep work this week, the students learned:
1. The boolean data type and boolean expressions.
1. Logical operators (``>``, ``<``, etc.) and ``==`` vs. ``===``.
1. Logical AND, OR and NOT.
1. ``if / else if / else`` statements.
1. Three common error types (syntax, runtime, logic).
1. How to use ``console.log`` to help debug code.

## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)
### Announcements
1. Note the due date for the first large assignment (should be 2 - 4 weeks away).
1. The assignment will be active in Canvas soon, and the students know enough after class 2 to begin the first part of the project.

### Class 2 Topics That Require More Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Recommend walking through the debugging exercises to reinforce how to spot the different error types, how to use error messages to find bugs, and how to systematically find and fix logic errors.
1. Emphasize why ``===`` should be used instead of ``==``.
1. Review the meaning of the truth tables for logical AND and logical OR.
1. Clarify with live coding examples:
   1. The difference between an ``if / else if`` block and two successive ``if`` blocks.
   1. Nested conditionals.
   1. Check multiple conditions with ``&&`` and ``||``.
   1. When would we use ``!``?
1. Tonight the studio is a non-coding activity.
   1. Refer to the TA notes, and prepare a brief intro about why this activity will benefit the students.

## Studio (TA Notes)
1. Even though this is a non-coding studio, it requires more preparation and thought than usual, since it helps the students build confidence and identify what they want to get out of this class.
1. Refer to the notes you received from LaunchCode. You can also read the notes [here](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev/blob/master/wiki-materials/Goal%20Setting%20%26%20Mindset%20(TA%20Notes).pdf).
