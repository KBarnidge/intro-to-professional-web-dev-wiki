the Intro to Professional Web Dev Wiki https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki/wiki.

# History
The repo behind https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki/wiki is not a normal repo.
That repo can NOT be seen via the github UI, therefor it does NOT allow for the creation of PRs.

We wanted PRs for two reasons
1. QA process for Education team
2. Allow contributions from outside Education team by forking and submitting a PR

# Created intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki Repo (this repo)
Any additions or updates that need to appear on https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki/wiki
should be committed to this repo. Create feature branches and PRs.

# Deploying to the Wiki
To deploy new commits to the visible wiki https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki/wiki,

2. Have the PR reviewed, approved, and then merged
3. run the ./deploy-to-wiki.sh in the root of this repo
