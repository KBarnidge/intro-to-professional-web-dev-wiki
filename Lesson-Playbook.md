Each class will have a playbook entry that contains the following information:
1. Course schedule (F = full-class, G = small-group)

      1. Topic review with live coding examples and/or lesson notes
      1. Exercise or Concept Check review
      1. Q&A about the prep work
      1. Additional examples
      1. Assignment walkthrough
      1. Studio introduction
   1. Studio (G)
   1. Impact-created activities (G)

1. Lesson-specific notes
   1. Tips for teaching difficult topics or addressing common student misconceptions

IMPORTANT: The lesson notes are NOT intended to provide the instructor with a ready-made plan for teaching the class. Instead, they identify key topics that need to be addressed and provide suggestions about how to approach tricky concepts. The detailed planning for a lesson is left to the teacher.

_TODO: Create first lesson info to see how it looks._

_TODO: Figure out how to add folders or directories to organize groups of lessons (e.g. "Lessons 1 - 4" or "Strings and Arrays")._
