# Communication
Positive and productive communication between instructors, TAs, and students is vital to a successful class.

## Be Empathetic and Positive
Students will be looking to instructors, TAs, and the curriculum for knowledge and guidance. Have empathy when speaking to students, remember that learning to code is not an easy task. Keep in mind that we all learn at different speeds and in different ways. Be supportive and patient as the students demonstrate and describe their issues.

## Stand By the Curriculum
Help LaunchCode make the course better and maintain the students trust in curriculum by following these rules.
* Please send feedback, suggestions, and bug reports to a LaunchCode staff member
* Do not speak negatively of the curriculum in front of the students
* Do not teach topics or tools that are not in the curriculum
  * It's ok to mention other topics or tools to enrich the students

## Student Status in the Class
LaunchCode staff controls student enrollment. If there is a question about a student's enrollment status, please contact a LaunchCode staff member. If a student is asking about their status, they should also contact a LaunchCode staff member.

# Common Student Issues
## Students Falling Behind
Students fall behind for many reasons. When students fall behind they tend to try and catch up **during** class and that only makes the problem worse. Students should focus on the in person instruction and studio. Students can catch up on the reading and exercises at home.

## Skipping Course Activities
Often students will fail to do the prep work **before** class. The in person instruction is meant as a review and NOT a replacement for the prep work. This causes the student to fall behind on the concepts. This can cause the student to NOT participate in the studio assignment. That causes a cycle of the student missing multiple steps of a deliberate learning path, that leaves the student constantly feeling behind. Have the students focus on the current class task and catch up at home.

Another reasons students skip the studio is to work on the large programming assignments. While these assignments are very important, they should be mainly worked on at home. Students can ask questions and request help during down times in class. Students should NOT skip in class activities to work on their assignments.

## Poor Attendance 
Students are **required** to attend class. Attendance is the clearest factor for success. Attendance is taken by TAs and report to LaunchCode. LaunchCode reserves the right to un-enroll students due to student absence.

Make it clear to students that class attendance is required and crucial for success. Attendance exceptions can be made by LaunchCode staff. Have students contact LaunchCode staff regarding attendance exceptions.

## Keeping Advanced Students Engaged
Some students learn the material very quickly and become disengaged by the class pace. Working ahead in the class is discouraged. Advanced students can be an asset to staff and other students. Suggest to advanced students, that they help fellow students instead of working ahead.

## Cheating
Unfortunately some students try to get through the class by having other people complete their course work. The warning signs of this is that the student shows few signs of understanding the concepts in class, however the student turns in perfect solutions for assignments. If cheating is suspected please contact LaunchCode staff.

## Student Considering Dropping Out
Sometimes students express intent to drop out of the class. Please listen to the students with empathy. You should notify LaunchCode staff and also have the students contact LaunchCode staff for support and guidance.

Students have thoughts of withdrawal for a number of reasons, some of which are unavoidable and require withdrawal. Students also consider dropping out due the difficulty of the class. Remind students that their feelings are valid, because everyone struggles with the class. Verify that the student is taking advantage of help in person or via slack.
