# Class 1 (Data and Variables)
In the prep work this week, the students learned:
1. How to declare, initialize, and reassign variables,
1. The ``number`` and ``string`` data types, and how to convert between them,
1. The mathematical operators (``+, -, *, /, **, %, ++, --``) and order of operations.

## Announcements
1. Welcome! First day pep talk.
1. Class 2 prep work should be active by the end of class.

## Large Group Time
### First Class Reminders
1. Use Canvas to access course content
1. Have a Repl.it account
   1. Review workspace panels and important menu items (this can be done in the live coding examples).
   1. Use the link posted in Canvas to enroll in the repl.it _classroom_.
1. Expectations for students:
   1. Do ALL of the prep work before class.
   1. Ask questions often.
   1. Make use of the help and resources available.
1. Introduce the TAs and assign groups (may be done during the studio intro).
1. Other relevant contact information.

### Lesson
1. Quick review of the string and number data types.  Note: The JavaScript ``number`` data type does not distinguish between integers and decimals.
1. Converting between ``string`` and ``number`` data types.
1. Review *declaring*, *initializing*, and *reassigning* variables. (Live coding format).
   1. ``let`` vs. ``const``. When should each be used?
   1. ``a = a + 2`` vs. ``a += 2``. Note ``-=``, ``*=``, etc.
   1. Ask "What if..." (Students should explore or follow along in repl.it).
      1. Type ``num = 1`` without ``let`` or ``const``?
      1. Try ``"30"/10``?
      1. etc.
1. MODULUS!!!!!
   1. This is likely a new idea for many of the students. Provide a clear, deliberate explanation (with examples) of what it does.
   1. Why would we need to use ``%``? Don't get too detailed yet, but note some simple scenarios where it might be necessary. The students do not know ``if/else`` yet, so keep your explanation non-code specific.
1. Live coding examples for ``console.log`` statements:
   1. Strings, numbers, and variables inside the ``()``,
   1. Mathematical operators inside the ``()``,
   1. Using ``+`` on strings vs. numbers produces different results. Review.
1. Walk through the syntax and how to use ``readline-sync`` to collect user input from the console.
   1. Define **console** and point it out in repl.it.
   1. Live coding examples.
1. Studio intro
   1. Overview of how studio sessions run and how to best take advantage of the time.
   1. Tasks will be completed in repl.it classroom.
   1. Studio assignments must be submitted by the due date so the TAs can review the work and provide feedback before the next class.
   1. Display the studio instructions page and provide a quick lead in.
   1. Note the "call-back" option to do a post-op of the studio task before class ends.

## Alternate Lesson Notes
### General Guide for Your Lessons
1. Make sure you read ALL of the chapter, exercises, and studio pages. This includes solving the exercises and studio activities yourself. The more you understand what the students see in the prep work, the better you can tailor your lesson.
1. Do not try to "wing it"! Create lesson notes to follow so you do not forget something, and generate clear slides.
1. Aim for a middle ground between providing too much detail (for the students who did the prep work and understood it completely) and not enough detail (for those who did not finish the prep work or were fuzzy on some of the ideas). The large group session is NOT a substitute for the prep work, but it should allow those who missed some of the content to make progress.
1. Make sure your lesson meets each of the objectives.

### Class 1 Topics That Require More Attention
1. ``let`` vs. ``const``. When should each be used?
1. Discourage the use of ``var``.
1. ``+=``, ``-=``, etc. can be used as a shortcut (``num = num + 3`` vs. ``num += 3``).
1. Modulus.
